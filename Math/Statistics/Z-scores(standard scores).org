* Z scores( standardised scores)
  use them for *comparing two different observations*, from *two different data sets*.
  Z scores represent how far either side of a mean a particular observed value *in unit of standard deviation* in that data set actually is.

  Two important formulas about Z-scores:

(1) $z=\dfrac{(x - \mu)}\sigma$

(2) $z=\dfrac{(\overline{x} - \mu)}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$

** Exercise
*** Exercise 1
Suppose the heights of adult *females* is normally distributed with a *mean of 66* inches and a standard *deviation of 1.75* inches.
Suppose that the heights of adult *males* is normally distributed with a *mean of 70* inches and a standard *deviation of 2.2* inches.
Jill is *70 inches* tall and Jack is *75 inches* tall. *Which person is taller relative to those of their same gender*?

Jill:

$z=\dfrac{(x-\mu)}\sigma=\dfrac{(77-66)}{1.75}=2.29$

Jack:

$z=\dfrac{(x-\mu)}\sigma=\dfrac{(75-70)}{2.2}=2.27$

Relatively speaking, Jill is taller than Jack because her standard score is greater

[[http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/how-to-correctly-interpret-p-values][very good interpretation about p-value]]

** Example-1
Example:
The packet says that each 200g packet of choconutties contains 70g of peanuts or more.
Halen can't open up all the packets to check, so she want to use a statistic test on a sample of the packets.

$H_0$ is called H "nought" is the thing we're trying to provide evidence against.
for Helen, the $H_0$ is that the choconutties are as they should be:
The mean or average weight of peanuts in the packet is >= 70g

The alternative hypothesis is called $H_1$ or $H_a$, is what we're trying to prove:
the peanuts of packets is < 70g, for Helen, this is what he against.

  - significance level: $\alpha=0.05$
  - if p-value < $\alpha$, she reject $H_0$

Helen choose 20 from 400 packets of Choco-nutties, to weight the peanuts.
- if all the values were < 70g with means of 30g for instance. then H0 is fail

Now, the average = 68.7g, and the p-value = 0.18.

which means:

The probability of getting a mean of 68.7 or less, from a sample of this size(and variation) is *18%*.
If the mean weight of the peanuts in the population is 70 grams or more

  - significance level: $\alpha=0.05$
  - if p-value < $\alpha$, she reject $H_0$

0.18 > 0.05, $H_0$ can not be rejected

p-value > significance level ===> *no* evidence to *reject* $H_0$
p-value < significance level ===> *has* evidence to *reject* $H_0$
