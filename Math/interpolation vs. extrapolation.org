* what is interpolation and extrapolation

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4_MJg_c49k


interpolation is give a x between dataset's min_x and max_x and using the
predict function( have got from the dataset) to predict the y of this x.

extrapolation is give a x out the range of dataset's min_x and max_x and using
the predict function( have got from the dataset) to predict the y of this x.

who is better, of course the interpolation is better.

because we don't know whether the function will change dramatically out the
range of dataset.
